    <h1>Bolus Calculator App</h1>
    <p>
        The Bolus Calculator App is a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals with diabetes determine their ideal insulin dosage based on personalized inputs. By automating the calculation process, the app takes the guesswork out of insulin management, ensuring accurate dosages that help prevent both high and low blood sugar levels.

    <h2>Skills used</h2>
<ul  class="david">
    <li>WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for building the application's intuitive user interface.</li>
    <li>SQL Database for securely storing user data and ensuring smooth login/signup functionality.</li>
    <li>C# Programming for implementing the bolus calculation logic and database integration.</li>
    <li>XAML for designing a responsive layout that enhances the user experience.</li>
</ul>
    <p>
        The primary aim of this project was to develop a simple yet effective tool that can be used daily to manage diabetes more efficiently. It combines essential technical skills, such as database management and algorithm implementation, with thoughtful UI/UX design to provide a seamless experience for users. The app not only helps users calculate insulin doses but also empowers them to make informed decisions about their health, reducing the risks of miscalculation.

        By showcasing this project, I demonstrate my ability to integrate multiple technologies to solve real-world problems, ensuring both functionality and ease of use.
